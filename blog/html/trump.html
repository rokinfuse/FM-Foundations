                <p>

                <h2>My famous quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you can’t get rich dealing with politicians, there’s something wrong with you.</li>
                    <li>A certificate of live birth is not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination as a birth certificate.
                    </li>
                    <li>I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.</li>
                    <li>He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you.</li>
                    <li>One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people don’t go into government.</li>
                </ul>
